# Mersad - @mersadajan

Hello there 👋 &nbsp; I am Mersad, a fullstack webdeveloper from Berlin, Germany. I have been a coder for a long time and done a lot of online courses over the past years in my free time. It was always an interesting hobby and I had so much fun learning and building things that I decided to go further. Just recently I finished the awesome Le Wagon Bootcamp and I am now looking forward to join the tech industry as a developer 💪

During the bootcamp I learned a lot about Ruby and Ruby on Rails, but my heart belongs to JavaScript ❤️  
I can't wait to dig deeper into the MERN stack to build cool apps and websites.

## Things I am working on right now

- I got two projects in the pipepline that I want to bring to production, have not yet decided which to focus on, though
- Working on Shillcoin with my flatmate
- Polishing my UI/UX skills using Whimsical and Figma

## What I am learning

- Improving my MERN skills by building small projects and bringing them to production
- Graphl and Typescriot as a nice addition to the MERN stack
- I plan to add a bit to my frontend stack by learning vue and svelte in the future
