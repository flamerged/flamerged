# Mersad - @mersadajan

Hello there 👋 &nbsp; I am Mersad, a fullstack webdeveloper from Berlin, Germany. I have been a coder for a long time and done a lot of online courses over the past years in my free time. It was always an interesting hobby and I had so much fun learning and building things that I decided to go further. Just recently I finished the awesome Le Wagon Bootcamp and I am now looking forward to join the tech industry as a developer 💪

During the bootcamp I learned a lot about Ruby and Ruby on Rails, but my heart belongs to JavaScript ❤️  
I can't wait to dig deeper into the MERN stack to build cool apps and websites.

## Things I am working on right now

- Going through my repos to polish up some projects before turning them public
- Building a personal webite using React
- Polishing my UI/UX skills using Figma

## What I am learning

- Refreshing my MERN skills with some online courses and building small projects
- Interested in learning Vue, Svelte and Flutter next
- I like Python too, so might go back to "automating the boring stuff"
