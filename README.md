# Mersad - @mersadajan

Hello there 👋 &nbsp; I am Mersad, a fullstack webdeveloper from Berlin, Germany. I have been a coder for a long time and done a lot of online courses over the past years in my free time. It was always an interesting hobby and I had so much fun learning and building things that I decided to go further. Just recently I finished the awesome Le Wagon Bootcamp and I am now working as a fullstack developer at reteach.io 💪

During the bootcamp I learned a lot about Ruby and Ruby on Rails, but my heart belongs to JavaScript ❤️  
Because I use JavaScript for the front- and backend, I can't wait to dig deeper into the MERN and MEVN stack to build cool apps and websites.
At work we use TypeScript, Vue, Nuxt, NestJS, Postgres, TypeORM, Bootstrap and GraphQL. Most of the tech used in our stack is new to me and I got quite a lot to learn the coming months and years. NestJS in particular is a very interesting framework to work with.

## Things I am working on right now

- 9-5 is spent at Reteach
- I got two projects in the pipepline that I want to bring to production, have not yet decided which to focus on, though (codenames: burger and together)
- Working on Shillcoin with my flatmate
- Polishing my UI/UX skills using Whimsical and Figma

## What I am learning

- Due to the fact that I have to get into my companies tech stack ASAP I switched my learning order. My focus is now on:
  - TypeScript -> GraphQL -> Vue -> Nest. TypeScript and GraphQL were on my plate anyway.
- Svelte in the future
